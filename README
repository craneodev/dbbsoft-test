🏗 Architecture
I defined the infrastructure fully as code (IaC) using AWS CDK (TypeScript).
 - Compute: AWS Elastic Beanstalk (Platform: Docker on Amazon Linux 2023).
 - Registry: AWS ECR (I implemented automated image replication logic).
 - CI/CD: GitHub Actions (I set up automated versioning and deployment).
 - Networking: VPC, Public Subnets, Security Groups (I configured traffic forwarding: Port 80 -> 8080).

=============================================================================

💡 Key Engineering Decisions
I made the following engineering choices during the implementation:
1. Amazon Linux 2023 & Docker Compose
Since the AL2023 platform requires explicit configuration to run Docker containers via environment properties, I created a docker-compose.yml file. My CDK code dynamically bundles this file and deploys it to Elastic Beanstalk along with the ECR image URI.
2. Semantic Versioning
Instead of using the latest tag (which I consider an anti-pattern), I configured the pipeline to extract the version directly from package.json (e.g., 1.0.1). I ensured that immutable tags are created in ECR for every deploy, enabling safe rollbacks.
3. Security & Networking
I deployed Elastic Beanstalk within the default VPC but explicitly defined Public Subnets and Security Groups. I configured the security rules to allow ingress traffic strictly on port 80.

🚀 Deployment Instructions (Local)
Here is how you can deploy my solution locally.

Prerequisites:
 - AWS CLI (configured via aws configure)
 - Node.js (v18+) & NPM
 - Docker Desktop (must be running)

Steps:
1. Install Dependencies:
 - npm install
2. Bootstrap Account (One-time setup):
 - cdk bootstrap
3. Deploy:
 - cdk deploy
4. Cleanup (Destroy resources):
 - cdk destroy

🤖 CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
I implemented an automated GitFlow to handle the release process:
Bump Version: When I push to main, a workflow triggers that increments the patch version in package.json (e.g., 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1), commits the change, and pushes it to the prod branch.
Deploy: Pushing to prod triggers cdk deploy. I configured this step to build the Docker image with the new version tag and update the Elastic Beanstalk environment automatically.
